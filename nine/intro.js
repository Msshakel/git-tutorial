// Chapter Nine: Functional Programming With Javascript

// What is Functional Programming?
`Functional Programming is a programming paradigm-a style of building the
 structure and elements of computer programs-that treats computaition as the
 evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state amd mutable data-wikipedia`
